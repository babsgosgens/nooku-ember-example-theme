Nooku Platform
==============

What is Nooku Platform ?
-----------------------

Nooku Platform is an open-source web application platform. Developed and maintained by [Timble](http://timble.net) with
 the help of passionate developers from all over the world.

Nooku Platform uses a [component based architecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component-based_software_engineering)
and includes everything needed to create components according to the [Hierarchical Model-View-Contoller][HMVC] (HMVC) pattern.

By doing most of the repetitive work for you, Nooku Platform greatly reduces the time to develop all kinds of websites
and web applications, allowing you to focus on the things that matter : business logic and the user experience.

Why Nooku Platform ?
--------------------

Nooku Platform was [born at the end of 2010][nooku-birth] with the goal to create a [leaner][nooku-leaner] and [meaner][nooku-meaner]
multi-site and multi-lingual distro of [Joomla](http://www.joomla.org) 1.5. Originally named Nooku Server and renamed to
Nooku Platform in 2013.

Compatibility with Joomla was dropped soon after Joomla 1.5 reached end of life period in 2012. Since then, development continued in an effort to completely refactor the code base to a modern and lean architecture using well-established coding standards and best practices.

At the moment Nooku Platform is at version 0.9 and work is ongoing to remove the last bits of Joomla legacy code. Once
this work is completed an 1.0 alpha release will be made available.

Experimental Only
-----------------

The platform includes the newest of the new Nooku features. Be forewarned: it's designed for developers and early adopters,
and can sometimes break down completely. Not for the faint of heart!

The platform uses a rapid agile development cycle with almost daily changes. Upgrades between versions are not provided.
If you want to use the platform it's best to choose one of the 0.x releases and stick with it.

Requirements
------------

Nooku Platform is only supported on PHP 5.3.3 and up running MySQL v5.x, or similar and requires Nginx web server to run.


Installation
------------

* Clone this repository at [https://github.com/nooku/nooku-platform](https://github.com/nooku/nooku-platform)

```
    $ git clone https://github.com/nooku/nooku-platform
```

* Switch to the [develop](https://github.com/nooku/nooku-platform/tree/develop) branch

```
    $ git checkout develop
```

* Install [VirtualBox](http://www.virtualbox.org/)

* Install [Vagrant](http://downloads.vagrantup.com/)

* Run `vagrant up` in the repository directory. This will download the [nooku/box](http://github.com/nooku/nooku-server)
and setup your development environment.

```
    $ vagrant up
```

* Add the following line into /etc/hosts

```
    33.33.33.63 nooku.dev webgrind.nooku.dev phpmyadmin.nooku.dev
```

* You can now reach Nooku at [nooku.dev](http://nooku.dev/)
* You can login into the admin application at [nooku.dev/administrator](http://nooku.dev/) using the username and password `admin@localhost.home`/`admin`.
* You can access the APC dashboard at [nooku.dev/apc](http://nooku.dev/apc) and phpinfo() at [nooku.dev/phpinfo](http://nooku.dev/phpinfo).
* [Varnish](https://www.varnish-cache.org/) cache runs in front of the Nooku application but passes through all requests by default. To enable Varnish, SSH into the box and execute `varnish enable`. Purge the cache using `varnish purge`, and disable again with `varnish disable`.
* You can tweak the virtual machine configuration by copying the `box.config.yaml-dist` file to `box.config.yaml` and edit its contents. If you want to run multiple boxes for multiple projects, you should change the name of the box through this file to avoid naming conflicts in Virtualbox.

Contributing
------------

We appreciate any contribution to Nooku Platform, whether it is related to bugs, grammar, or simply a suggestion or
improvement. We ask that any contribution follows a few simple guidelines in order to be properly received.

We follow the [GitFlow][gitflow-model] branching model, from development to release. If you are not familiar with it,
there are several guides and tutorials to make you understand what it is about. If you haven't, you will probably want
to get started by installing this very good collection of [git extensions][gitflow-extensions].

What you should know before submitting a pull request :

- If you are submitting a bug-fix, or an enhancement that is not a breaking change, submit your pull request to the
branch corresponding to the latest stable release of the framework, such as the 0.9 `release` branch.
-  If you are submitting a breaking change or an entirely new feature, submit your pull request against the `develop`
branch.
- It's very well appreciated, and highly suggested, to start a new feature branch whenever you want to make changes or
add functionalities. It will make it much easier for us to just checkout your feature branch and test it, before merging
it into `develop`
- We will not consider pull requests made to the `master`.
