This project is meant to be a group effort. Feel free to add to this theme by sending in PRâ€™s.

#### Call for help
Nooku Platform is included in this repository at the moment, as I have adapted *ArticlesControllerArticle* to allow JSON requests.

The idea is to have this theme available as a [Brunch](http://brunch.io/) skeleton.

If anyone can submit a PR with a more elegant solution, say an Articles component override, that would be nice. If such a component override could also allow for frontend editing, than that would be even nicer.
