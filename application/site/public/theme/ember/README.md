# Brunch with Ember Reloaded

![build status](https://travis-ci.org/gcollazo/brunch-with-ember-reloaded.png)

A [Brunch](http://brunch.io) skeleton for creating ambitious web applications using [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com). Based on the official Ember [Starter Kit](https://github.com/emberjs/starter-kit/archive/master.zip).

## Demo

I built a demo app using this skeleton, based on the [Building an App with Ember.js](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga99hMi7wfY) video by [Tom Dale](http://twitter.com/tomdale).

**Demo**: [ember-bloggr](http://dev.gcollazo.com/ember-bloggr)

**Source**: [https://github.com/gcollazo/ember-bloggr](https://github.com/gcollazo/ember-bloggr)

## Versions
- [Ember](http://emberjs.com)
- [Ember Data](https://github.com/emberjs/data)
- [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com)
- [jQuery](http://jquery.com)
- [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com)

## Other versions of this skeleton

- [ES6](https://github.com/gcollazo/brunch-with-ember-reloaded/tree/es6): Experimental version using ES6 module syntax.
- [CoffeeScript](https://github.com/gcollazo/brunch-with-ember-reloaded/tree/coffeescript)


## Getting started

Before using brunch-with-ember-reloaded you will need to install [Brunch](http://brunch.io/).

```
brunch new gh:gcollazo/brunch-with-ember-reloaded <appname>
cd <appname>
brunch watch -s
```
Open [http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333) on your browser.

## Generators

This skeleton makes use of [scaffolt](https://github.com/paulmillr/scaffolt#readme) generators to help you create common files quicker. To use first install scaffolt globally with `npm install -g scaffolt`. Then you can use the following command to generate files.

```
scaffolt model <name>             →    app/models/Name.js
scaffolt view <name>              →    app/views/NameView.js
scaffolt controller <name>        →    app/controllers/NameController.js
scaffolt arraycontroller <name>   →    app/controllers/NamesController.js
scaffolt route <name>             →    app/routes/NameRoute.js
scaffolt template <name>          →    app/templatesname.hbs
scaffolt component <name>         →    app/components/NameComponent.js
                                       app/templates/components/name.hbs
```

There are more commands you can do with scaffolt and also instruction on how to create your own generators, so make sure you check out the [docs](https://github.com/paulmillr/scaffolt#readme).

## Testing

To run you will need [Karma](https://github.com/karma-runner) you will need to install [phantomjs](https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs). If you want to run your tests on other browsers consult the Karma docs.

```
brew update && brew install phantomjs
```

To run tests continiously as you write code and tests (for now) you must open two terminal windows.

```
brunch watch -s
```

```
karma start
```

## Building for production
This skeleton supports the production versions of ember and ember-data. Just build using the --production flags.

```
brunch build --production
```

You can also have modules load only when you are on a specific environment (production / development). Just add the modules you want loaded to the corresponging subdirectory of the `envs` top level directory. All modules will be imported by the module `'config/env'`.

```js
var myEnvVars = require('config/env');
myEnvVars.envFileName.property;
```


## Updating Ember

To updated ember.js, ember-data.js and handlebars.js to the latest stable versions, just run this command on the project root.

```
npm run update:ember
```

## Updating Skeleton

This command will replace `package.json`, `README.md`, `config.js`, `karma.conf.js` and the `generators` directory with the latest version from the GitHub repository.

```
npm run update:skeleton
npm install
```
If you want to update an older version of the skeleton which doesn't have support for the update:skeleton command you can get the `setup.js` by running:

```
curl https://raw.github.com/gcollazo/brunch-with-ember-reloaded/master/setup.js > setup.js
node setup.js update:skeleton
```
